# ship detection challenge
We are going to build a ship detection system specifically for mediterranean sea. Datasets being used are following:	
  -  [Mediterranean Sea](https://www.hs-augsburg.de/homes/beckmanf/searchwing/flug20190519/picam/): Actual photage from a mediterranean sea with no boat. Though drone wil work with such images in practice.


We are divided into following teams. Of course these are not final, please create more as you see fit. Each team can push their code and related stuff to this repository. In case of code, please write functions with some description of input,output and usage of it.
  - Sliding Window
  - Augmentation
  - Train (using some-small-neural-network)
  - Train (using resnet)
